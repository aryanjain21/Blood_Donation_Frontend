  <h1>About Us</h1>
  <p>
    'Blood Bank India' is the first product resulted out of the <br>community welfare initiative called 'People Project'
    from uSiS Technologies. Universally, 'Blood' is recognized as the most precious element that sustains life. It saves
    innumerable lives across the world in a variety of conditions. Once in every 2- seconds, someone, somewhere is
    desperately in need of blood. More than 29 million units of blood components are transfused every year. The need for
    blood is great - on any given day, approximately 39,000 units of Red Blood Cells are needed. Each year, we could
    meet only up to 1% (approx) of our nationâ€™s demand for blood transfusion.

    Despite the increase in the number of donors, blood remains in short supply during emergencies, mainly attributed to
    the lack of information and accessibility. We positively believe this tool can overcome most of these challenges by
    effectively connecting the blood donors with the blood recipients.
